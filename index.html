                        <p>My actual journey began when I was listening to my in-laws talk about their techy jobs. So I asked if they built web pages and they laughed and said no, it's classifed. That's what fueled my curiosity into learning how to build a web page. I had gone back home and began researching and learning then eventually trying it myself.</p>

                        <p>I will admit it was a giant leap of faith, going from some one who never coded a day in their life to some one who was learning to code. I had no faith in myself, or my abilities. But that never stopped me. My confidence grew as I played around in <a href="https://codepen.io/ladylokilaufeyjarson" class="hidden-link">Codepen</a>. To this very day I have been persuing my passions with Technology.</p>
